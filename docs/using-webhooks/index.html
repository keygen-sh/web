<p>Use webhooks to be notified about events that happen within your Keygen
account. If you need help after reading this, can reach out to us anytime
at <a href="mailto:support@keygen.sh">support@keygen.sh</a>.</p>
<p>This tutorial is written in JavaScript, but you can follow along in any
other language that you&#39;re comfortable in. Throughout this tutorial, you
will see placeholders e.g. <code>{ACCOUNT}</code> within the code examples that
will need to be replaced with your account&#39;s slug (or ID), or other
resource information.</p>
<p>Before getting started, you will need to log into your <strong><a href="https://app.keygen.sh">Dashboard</a></strong>
and generate a <strong>product token</strong>, which will be used to authenticate with
Keygen&#39;s servers while accepting webhook events.</p>
<div class="notice notice--warning">
  <strong>Your admin and product tokens carry many privileges and should always
  be kept secret. Do not share your secret API tokens in publicly accessible
  areas such GitHub, embed them in client-facing code e.g. inside of your
  product, and so forth.</strong> <a href="/docs/api#authentication">Learn more.</a>
</div>

<h2 id="webhook-terminology">Webhook terminology</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Webhook events</strong> are certain events that happen within the context
of your Keygen account, such as a user being created, a successful
license validation, or your account being updated.</li>
<li><strong>Webhook endpoints</strong> are resources defined within your account to which
Keygen sends event data to. A single webhook event may be sent to many
webhook endpoints.</li>
<li><strong>Webhooks</strong> refers to the overall concept of sending webhook event data to
an account&#39;s webhook endpoints.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="about-webhooks">About webhooks</h2>
<p>Certain events that happen within Keygen&#39;s systems may not be immediately available when
making an API request e.g., when a license expires. A naive solution for checking
if a license has expired would be to poll Keygen&#39;s API every <code>n</code> minutes so that
you can act upon that expiration at the time it occurs, e.g. to send an email to the
license owner, or to update your own database records. This obviously wouldn&#39;t scale
to hundreds or even thousands of licenses, causing a strain on both your systems
as well as Keygen&#39;s systems with the amount of requests polling would require.</p>
<p>Webhooks solve this problem by letting you register a <a href="/docs/api#webhook-endpoints-object">Webhook Endpoint</a> URL that Keygen
will notify anytime an event happens within the context of your Keygen account. When an event
occurs e.g., when a new license is created by a user, Keygen creates a <a href="/docs/api#webhook-events-object">Webhook Event</a>
resource. This resource contains all the relevant information about what just happened
at the time it happened, including the type of event and a snapshot of the data
associated with that event.</p>
<p>Keygen then sends the Webhook Event resource to any Webhook Endpoints defined within
your account via an <code>HTTP POST</code> request so that you can immediately act upon the event,
allowing the potential for business automation. You can find <a href="/docs/api#webhooks-event-types">a full list of webhook
event types in the API docs</a>.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use-webhooks">When to use webhooks</h2>
<p>The result of most Keygen requests (e.g., creating users or licenses) are reported synchronously
to your code and don’t <strong>require</strong> webhooks for further action. However, depending on your
business requirements, you may want to perform additional actions behind-the-scenes, e.g.
after a user is created, you may want to also create a new <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>
customer, <a href="/docs/storing-metadata">storing the <code>stripeAccountId</code> in the user&#39;s metadata attribute</a>.</p>
<p>Automating communication between Keygen and your payment provider (e.g. Stripe) is the
most common use-case for using webhooks, allowing you to respond to events on both sides.
For example, when a license is created by one of your users within Keygen, you can charge
their Stripe customer profile for that new license; or when a payment fails within Stripe,
you can suspend their license within Keygen until the payment is successfully processed.</p>
<p>You might also use webhooks to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email a license key to a customer after a successful purchase</li>
<li>Update or create new records in your own database when a specific event occurs (when for example,
you manage your users within your own database instead of within Keygen)</li>
<li>Email a user when a license expires (or better yet, before it expires!)</li>
<li>Automatically renew licenses before expiration using additional information from your payment
provider (e.g. you may check if their subscription is still active before renewing)</li>
<li>Create an audit trail for events of importance for each user or license</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="server-side-integration">Server-side integration</h3>
<p>If you&#39;re using Keygen server-side, some of the above mentioned steps could potentially
be done within a single transaction, but you may not want to introduce additional network
latency to your user creation process via performing requests to Keygen as well as to
your payment provider. Instead, you could listen for the <code>user.created</code> webhook event
that Keygen will send and handle things with your payment provider asynchronously.</p>
<h3 id="client-side-integration">Client-side integration</h3>
<p>If you&#39;re using Keygen client-side (i.e. allowing resource creation directly within your product),
handling webhook events might be a must-have, seeing as you may not be able to also create and
manage resources with your payment provider client-side, as you would be exposing your secret keys
within your code. Instead, you can perform license and machine creation requests client-side
<a href="/docs/authenticating-users">while authenticated as the currently logged in user</a> and listen
for the corresponding webhook events to act accordingly e.g., charging them for new licenses,
crediting them for deleted licenses or machines, etc.</p>
<h2 id="configuring-a-webhook-endpoint">Configuring a webhook endpoint</h2>
<p>Webhooks can be configured within the webhook endpoints resource section of your <a href="https://app.keygen.sh/webhook-endpoints">account dashboard</a>.
Clicking <strong>New Endpoint</strong> will reveal a form to add a new URL for receiving webhooks.</p>
<p>You can enter any URL you&#39;d like to have events sent to, but this should be a dedicated route or
page on your server, coded per the instructions below. <strong>For security reasons, the webhook URL
must use the HTTPS protocol.</strong></p>
<h2 id="receiving-webhook-events">Receiving webhook events</h2>
<p>Creating a webhook handler on your server is no different from creating any other route or page
on your website. With PHP, you might create a new <code>.php</code> file on your server; with Node and a
framework like Express, you would add a new route with the desired endpoint URL.</p>
<p>Webhook data is sent as JSON in the <code>POST</code> request body. The full event details are included and
can be used directly, though if security is a concern, or if it&#39;s important to confirm that Keygen
sent the webhook, you should use <strong>ONLY</strong> the event ID sent within the webhook to then retrieve
the remaining details from Keygen. If the event doesn&#39;t exist, then it wasn&#39;t from us. The example
below will be taking such a precaution.</p>
<div class="notice notice--warning">
  When delivering webhook events to your endpoint, an event is considered
  failed if the endpoint responds with a non-<code>2xx</code> status code. It will
  automatically be retried with an exponential backoff. We will perform
  15 retries over approximately 3 days or until your server responds
  with a <code>2xx</code> status.
</div>

<h4 id="example-webhook-handler-using-node-and-express">Example webhook handler using Node and Express</h4>
<p>To see a full working example of webhook integration, check out our <a href="https://keygen.sh/integrate/stripe">example Node.js app</a>
which integrates Keygen and <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a> together.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">const fetch = require(&quot;node-fetch&quot;)
const express = require(&quot;express&quot;)
const bodyParser = require(&quot;body-parser&quot;)
const app = express()

app.use(bodyParser.json({ type: &quot;application/vnd.api+json&quot; }))
app.use(bodyParser.json({ type: &quot;application/json&quot; }))

app.post(&quot;/my/webhook/url&quot;, async (req, res) =&gt; {
  const { data: { id } } = req.body

  // Fetch the webhook to validate it and get its most up-to-date state
  const event = await fetch(`https://api.keygen.sh/v1/accounts/{ACCOUNT}/webhook-events/${id}`, {
    method: &quot;GET&quot;,
    headers: {
      &quot;Accept&quot;: &quot;application/vnd.api+json&quot;,
      &quot;Authorization&quot;: &quot;Bearer {PRODUCT_TOKEN}&quot;
    }
  })

  const { data, errors } = await event.json()
  if (errors) {
    return // Webhook event does not exist
  }

  switch (data.attributes.event) {
    case &quot;user.created&quot;:
      const user = JSON.parse(data.attributes.payload)

      // … do something when a user is created e.g. create a Stripe customer

      break
    case &quot;license.created&quot;:
      const license = JSON.parse(data.attributes.payload)

      // … do something when a license is created e.g. charge a user

      break
  }

  // Let Keygen know the event was received successfully
  res.sendStatus(200)
})

const server = app.listen(8080, &#39;localhost&#39;, () =&gt; {
  const { address, port } = server.address()

  console.log(`Listening at http://${address}:${port}`)
})
</code></pre>
<div class="notice notice--tip">
  <strong>Tip</strong>: A great way to test your webhook integration locally is to use
  <a href="https://ngrok.com"><code>ngrok</code></a>, which allows you to create secure tunnels
  to <code>localhost</code>, HTTPS and all. Assuming you&#39;re running on port <code>8080</code>,
  you can use the command: <code>ngrok http -host-header=localhost 8080</code>.
