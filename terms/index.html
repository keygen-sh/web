<p>Please read these Terms of Service (the &quot;Terms&quot; or &quot;Agreement&quot;) carefully. This Keygen Services Agreement is a legal agreement between Keygen LLC (&quot;Keygen&quot;, &quot;us&quot;, or &quot;we&quot;) and the entity or person (&quot;Customer&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, &quot;your&quot;, or &quot;user&quot;) who registered on the Keygen Account page to receive certain software licensing, distribution, data, technology and analytics services, and other business services that may be offered by Keygen and its affiliates (each, a &quot;Service&quot;). This Agreement describes the terms and conditions that apply to your use of the Services. We provide you with a more detailed description of the Services through published software libraries and application programming interfaces that may be used to access the Services (the &quot;API&quot;, or &quot;APIs&quot;) and additional resources we make available to you on our website. The Services and their permitted use are further described in Keygen&#39;s standard documentation (&quot;Documentation&quot;).</p>
<p>Wherever used in these Terms, &quot;you&quot;, &quot;your&quot; or similar terms means the person or legal entity accessing or using the Services. If you are accessing or using the Services on behalf of a company (such as your employer) or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these Terms.</p>
<p>YOU AGREE THAT BY REGISTERING FOR, ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES, YOU ARE ENTERING INTO A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT WITH KEYGEN. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS, YOU MUST NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES.</p>
<p>Keygen reserves the right to modify, supplement or replace these Terms, effective upon posting the changes on the Site or notifying you otherwise. For continued use of the Services following the posting of changes to these Terms or receipt of notice, you will be required to accept and agree to such changes to continue using the Services. You are responsible for regularly consulting the current version of the Terms prior to your use of the Services.</p>
<p><strong>You may not access or use any Services unless you agree to abide by all of the terms and conditions in this Agreement.</strong> If you do not understand any of the terms of this Agreement, please contact us before using the Services. You can contact us at: <a href="mailto:legal@keygen.sh">legal@keygen.sh</a>.</p>
<h2 id="1-the-services">1. The Services</h2>
<h3 id="1-1-your-keygen-account">1.1. Your Keygen Account</h3>
<h4 id="1-1-1-registration">1.1.1. Registration</h4>
<p>To register for a Keygen Account, you or the person or people submitting the application (your &quot;Representative&quot;) must provide us with your business or trade name, email, and certain other information about you that we require. We may also collect personal information (including name and email) about your beneficial owners, principals, and your Keygen Account administrator. Until you have submitted, and we have reviewed and approved, all required information, your Keygen Account will be available to you on a preliminary basis only, and we may terminate it at any time and for any reason.</p>
<h4 id="1-1-2-account-administrator-s-">1.1.2. Account Administrator(s)</h4>
<p>Your Keygen account will require at least 1 administrative user (&quot;Admin&quot;). Based on your Subscription Plan, you may be allowed to have more than a single Admin. Do not share Admin accounts between multiple persons. Attempts to exceed your allotted Admin limit may result in suspension of your account (see 1.14). You may not utilize a Product Token to circumvent the Admin limit of your Subscription Plan; as an example, you may not develop your own Dashboard UI to be utilized by unpermitted Admins for management of your Keygen Account and its resources.</p>
<h4 id="1-1-3-business-representative">1.1.3. Business Representative</h4>
<p>You and your Representative individually affirm to Keygen that your Representative is authorized to provide the information described in this Section 1.1.1. on your behalf and to bind you to these Terms. We may require you or your Representative to provide additional information or documentation demonstrating your Representative’s authority. Without the express written consent of Keygen, neither you nor your Representative may register or attempt to register for a Keygen Account on behalf of a user Keygen previously terminated from use of the Services.</p>
<p>If you are a sole proprietor, you and your Representative also affirm that your Representative is personally responsible and liable for your use of the Services and your obligations to your customers, including payment of any amounts owed under these Terms.</p>
<h4 id="1-1-4-consent-to-electronic-disclosures-and-notices">1.1.4. Consent to Electronic Disclosures and Notices</h4>
<p>By registering for a Keygen Account, you agree that such registration constitutes your electronic signature, and you consent to electronic provision of all disclosures and notices from Keygen (&quot;Notices&quot; or &quot;Notice&quot;), including those required by Law. You also agree that your electronic consent will have the same legal effect as a physical signature.</p>
<h4 id="1-1-5-api-and-dashboard">1.1.5. API and Dashboard</h4>
<p>Keygen has developed and provides access to the API that may be used to access the Services. You may use the API solely as described in the Documentation to use the Services on websites and through the applications identified in your Keygen Account. You may manage your Keygen Account, connect with other service providers, and enable additional features through the Keygen management dashboard (&quot;Dashboard&quot;).</p>
<p>You may not use the API for any purpose, function, or feature not described in the Documentation or otherwise communicated to you by us. Due to the nature of the Services, we will update the API and Documentation from time to time, and may add or remove functionality. We will provide you Notice in the event of material changes, deprecations, or removal of functionality from the API so that you may continue using the Services with minimal interruption.</p>
<p>We will make your API tokens (&quot;Tokens&quot;) available to you through the API and Dashboard. Some of your Keygen Account&#39;s Tokens, namely those which belong to an admin user (&quot;Admin Token&quot;) or to a product (&quot;Product Token&quot;), may permit any API call to your Keygen Account. You are responsible for securing your secret Tokens – do not publish or share them with any unauthorized persons. Failure to secure your secret keys will increase the likelihood of unauthorized use of your Keygen Account and potential losses to you or your customers. You should contact us immediately if you become aware of any unauthorized use of your secret Tokens or any other breach of security regarding the Services.</p>
<p>We provide more details on proper use of Tokens in the Documentation, such as how to utilize Tokens which are tied to a particular user and have less permissions (&quot;User Token&quot;) or how to utilize a Token tied to a particular license (&quot;Activation Token&quot;). Information on securing your Keygen Account is also available in the Documentation.</p>
<h3 id="1-2-subscription">1.2. Subscription</h3>
<p>Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Keygen shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide you with the Services. The Services are available on a free or paid subscription basis. You must select a subscription plan at the time of registration detailing the Services to be provided by Keygen, along with any applicable fees and payment terms (the &quot;Subscription Plan&quot;).</p>
<h3 id="1-3-updates-and-functionalities">1.3. Updates and Functionalities</h3>
<p>You acknowledge that from time to time Keygen may apply updates to the Services and that such updates may result in changes in the appearance and/or functionality of the Services (including the addition, modification, or removal of functionality, features, or content), and you agree to such changes. Without limiting the foregoing, Keygen may, in its sole discretion, change the functionality associated with certain Subscription Plans, including but not limited to discontinuing all or part of the Services offered on a free subscription basis.</p>
<h3 id="1-4-permitted-uses">1.4. Permitted Uses</h3>
<p>You are responsible for your own conduct when using the Services. You agree that you will only use the Services for lawful purposes and in a manner consistent with these Terms and any applicable rules, policies and guidelines established by Keygen in respect of the Services. Misuse or unauthorized use of the Services and its related systems or networks, or of any information or material available through the Services is strictly prohibited and Keygen reserves the right, at its sole discretion and without liability or prejudice to any other remedies that it may have, to immediately suspend or terminate access by any user who is using, or who Keygen reasonably believes is using, the Services in violation of these Terms.</p>
<h3 id="1-5-prohibited-uses">1.5. Prohibited Uses</h3>
<p>Without limiting Section 1.4, you agree not to use the Services to: (i) engage in conduct that would constitute a criminal or quasi-criminal offence, that would give rise to civil liability, or that would otherwise violate any applicable local, provincial, state, federal or international law or accepted Internet protocol; (ii) communicate, transmit, upload or post information that is inaccurate, incomplete, misleading, false or libellous; (iii) communicate, transmit, upload or post information or material that infringes intellectual property rights, privacy rights, rights of publicity or any other rights of any person; (iv) communicate, transmit, upload or post material that is obscene, vulgar, pornographic, abusive, defamatory, threatening, racist, sexist or otherwise objectionable; (v) attempt to interfere with or gain unauthorized access to the Services or its related systems or networks; (vi) advertise, solicit or otherwise promote the sale or other distribution of products or services, including products or services that compete with those offered through the Services, without Keygen’s consent; (vii) use or attempt to use the Services to gain unauthorized access to any person’s data or network; or (vii) otherwise use the Services in a manner that could, in the opinion of Keygen, adversely affect the ability of other users to use the Services or the Internet, including post or transmit information or data containing worms, viruses, Trojan horses or other disruptive components.</p>
<h3 id="1-6-third-party-products-and-services">1.6. Third Party Products and Services</h3>
<p>The Services may enable you to access, interact with or purchase products or services provided by third parties, including from third party websites or applications linked to or accessible through the Services (&quot;Third Party Services&quot;). Keygen provides access to Third Party Services as a convenience only, and such access does not imply any warranties, representations, endorsements, approvals or verification by Keygen of such Third Party Services. You acknowledge that the use of Third Party Services may be subject to the terms and conditions of such Third Party Services, and that any contract entered into or transaction completed through Third Party Services is between only you and the relevant third party.</p>
<h3 id="1-7-authorized-users">1.7. Authorized Users</h3>
<p>Only the specific individuals for whom you have paid the required fees and whom you designate through the applicable Service (&quot;Authorized Users&quot;) may access and use the Services. Some Services may allow you to designate different types of Authorized Users, in which case pricing and functionality may vary according to the type of Authorized User. Authorized Users may be you or your Affiliates’ employees, representatives, consultants, contractors, agents, or other third parties who are acting for your benefit or on your behalf. You may also permit your customers to have limited access to certain Services as Authorized Users, subject to the terms of our Customer Use Addendum. You may increase the number of Authorized Users permitted to access your instance of the Services by placing a new Subscription Plan or, in some cases, directly through the Service. In all cases, you must pay the applicable fee for the increased number of Authorized Users. You are responsible for compliance with this Agreement by all Authorized Users. All use of Services by you and your Authorized Users must be within the Scope of Use and solely for the benefit of you or your Affiliates. &quot;Affiliate&quot; means an entity which, directly or indirectly, owns or controls, is owned or is controlled by or is under common ownership or control with a party, where &quot;control&quot; means the power to direct the management or affairs of an entity, and &quot;ownership&quot; means the beneficial ownership of 50% (or, if the applicable jurisdiction does not allow majority ownership, the maximum amount permitted under such law) or more of the voting equity securities or other equivalent voting interests of the entity.</p>
<h3 id="1-8-access-to-services">1.8. Access to Services</h3>
<p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Keygen grants you a non-exclusive right to access and use the Services during the applicable Subscription Term (as defined below) in accordance with this Agreement, your applicable Scope of Use and the Documentation. If Keygen offers client software (e.g., a desktop or mobile application) for any Service, you may use such software solely with the Service, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. You acknowledge that our Services are on-line, subscription-based products and that we may make changes to the Services from time to time.</p>

<h3 id="1-10-credentials">1.10. Credentials</h3>

<h3 id="1-12-security">1.12. Security</h3>
<p>Keygen implements security procedures to help protect Your Data from security attacks. However, you understand that use of the Services necessarily involves transmission of Your Data over networks that are not owned, operated or controlled by us, and we are not responsible for any of Your Data lost, altered, intercepted or stored across such networks.

<h2 id="12-gdpr">12. GDPR</h2>
<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a comprehensive set of regulations made by the European Union that dictates what companies like Keygen must do in order to properly protect our customers&#39; data. These Terms act as a contract between Keygen and each customer, i.e. you.</p>
<p><em>Note: In GDPR terminology, we are the &quot;Data Processor&quot; and you (our customer) are the &quot;Data Controller&quot;. &quot;Data subjects&quot; are your customers, or end users, which you store within the Services.</em></p>
<h3 id="12-1-data-processing-addendum">12.1. Data Processing Addendum</h3>
<p>The following GDPR <strong>Data Processing Addendum</strong> (&quot;DPA&quot;) forms part of the Terms entered into by and between the Customer and Keygen. The purpose of this DPA is to reflect the parties&#39; agreement with regard to the processing of personal data in accordance with the requirements of Data Protection Legislation as defined below. By using our Services, you agree to be bound to the full Terms, including the DPA.</p>
<p>In the course of providing the Services to the Customer in accordance with the Agreement, Keygen may process personal data on behalf of the Customer. Keygen agrees to comply with the following provisions with respect to any personal data submitted by or for the Customer to the Services or collected and processed by or for the Customer through the Services.</p>
<p>This DPA shall not replace or supersede any agreement or addendum relating to processing of personal data negotiated by Customer and referenced in the Agreement, and any such individually negotiated agreement or addendum shall apply instead of this DPA.</p>
<p>In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Keygen commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. EU individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact Keygen at <a href="mailto:legal@keygen.sh">legal@keygen.sh</a>.</p>
<p>Keygen has further committed to cooperate with the panel established by the EU data protection authorities with regard to unresolved Privacy Shield complaints concerning data transferred from the EU in the context of the employment relationship.</p>
<p><small>
 In this DPA, &quot;Data Protection Legislation&quot; means the European Directives 95/46/EC and 2002/58/EC (as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC) and any legislation and/or regulation implementing or made in accordance with them, or which amends, replaces, re-enacts or consolidates any of them (including the General Data Protection Regulation [Regulation EU 2016/279]), and all other applicable laws relating to processing of personal data and privacy that may exist in any relevant jurisdiction.
</small></p>
<h4 id="12-1-1-">12.1.1.</h4>
<p>Keygen will act as a Data Processor to you by allowing you to store and retrieve any information that you store in our Services, as well as running reports and analysis on that information. This processing will continue from the time you create an account with us until you close the account. In order to prevent accidental loss of data, by default we retain a backup of data for up to 30 days after an account is closed. This backup is deleted after the account has been closed long enough to be sure you won’t need to recover any of the data.</p>
<p>You may request at any time that we delete all of the data in your Keygen account. Upon request, we may ask you for additional information for the purpose of verifying your identity to ensure that you have permission to enact the request.</p>
<p><em>Please note that after the data has been deleted, <strong>it cannot be recovered.</strong></em></p>
<h4 id="12-1-2-">12.1.2.</h4>
<p>Keygen shall process information to provide the Services in accordance with the Agreement. Keygen shall process information sent by the Customer and by the Customer&#39;s end users (the &quot;Data Subjects&quot;), identified through the Customer&#39;s implementation of the Services.</p>
<p>As an example, in a standard programmatic implementation, to utilize the Services user management features, the Customer may allow information of a Data Subject to be sent which includes the Data Subject&#39;s first and last name for the purpose of creating a user resource for the Data Subject so that the Data Subject may login to our Services to utilize Customer&#39;s software application.</p>
<p>The information about your Data Subjects may include their name, email, and other information related to their licenses. Because you have complete control over a resource&#39;s data, including its <code>metadata</code> attribute (which allows arbitrary key-values to be stored within it), it is your responsibility as the Data Controller to ensure that you only use the Services in a GDPR compliant way.</p>
<p>For a complete overview of the data we collect, please review our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<h4 id="12-1-3-">12.1.3.</h4>
<p>As the Data Processor, we will only act according to your instructions unless required by law to act without such instructions.</p>
<h4 id="12-1-4-">12.1.4.</h4>
<p>If a member of Keygen must access any information about your Data Subjects while performing their duties as a Data Processor, they are obligated to a duty of confidence.</p>
<h4 id="12-1-5-">12.1.5.</h4>
<p>As the Data Processor, we are responsible for taking the appropriate measures to ensure the security of processing.</p>
<h4 id="12-1-6-">12.1.6.</h4>
<p>We must provide any needed assistance to you in order to allow Data Subjects to exercise their rights under the GDPR.</p>
<h4 id="12-1-7-">12.1.7.</h4>
<p>We must assist you in meeting your GDPR obligations in relation to the security of processing, the notification of personal data breaches, and data protection impact assessments.</p>
<h4 id="12-1-8-">12.1.8.</h4>
<p>We must submit to audits and inspections, provide the controller with whatever information it needs to ensure that they are both meeting their Article 28 obligations, and tell the controller immediately if it is asked to do something infringing the GDPR or other data protection law of the EU or a member state.</p>
